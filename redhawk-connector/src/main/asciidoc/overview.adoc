== Creating a REDHAWK Connector Configuration

To create a REDHAWK Connector configuration in the Karaf web console: 

. Open a browser to `/system/console/configMgr` of your running Karaf instance. For example:
+

....
http://127.0.0.1:8181/system/console/configMgr
....
+

You are prompted to enter a username and password.
+

. Enter a username and password. (The default username is `karaf`, and the default password is `karaf`.)
+

TIP:  To change the default username or password, refer to the https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/#_users_groups_roles_and_passwords[Apache Karaf documentation].

. In the list of configurable services displayed on the Apache Karaf Web Console Configuration page, locate REDHAWK Connector.

The new configuration is displayed in the list of configurable services.

To create a REDHAWK Connector configuration using a file:

* In the $karaf.base/etc directory, add a file with this prefix: `redhawk.datasource.factory` and append a unique string with a leading dash (for example, `-myConfig.cfg`).

== Using Connection in blueprint

To inject the Redhawk Driver instance into your application, add the following lines in your `blueprint.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<reference id="myRedhawkService" interface="redhawk.Redhawk" filter="(connectionName='insert connection name'"/>)

<bean id="myApplicationBean" class="com.example.MyApplicationBeanImpl">
	<property name="redhawk" ref="myRedhawkService" />
</bean>
