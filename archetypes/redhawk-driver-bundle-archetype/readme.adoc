= Redhawk Driver Bundle Archetype

Simple Maven Archetype bundle to help create the template for a standalone jar/bundle project that uses the REDHAWK Driver asset. 

== Usage 

To create the archetype ensure that this archetype is registered in your local .m2 by running: 

----
mvn install
----

On this project. Once that's done you'll be able to use the archetype by running: 

----
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=redhawk -DarchetypeArtifactId=redhawk-driver-bundle-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
----

After running the command you'll be prompted for the following information:

* groupId
* artifactId
* version
* package

After entering in the necessary information you'll have a template project that already has the REDHAWK Driver dependency setup for you and a simple main method in App.java that utilizes the RedhawkDriver asset.
