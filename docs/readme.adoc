= Redhawk Enterprise Integration Docs

Module for aggregating the Manual and any project reports.

== Building Docs

The manual is an aggregate document build by pulling in the 'adoc' files from the other modules in
this project. REDHAWK Driver, REDHAWK REST docs are both partially built at compile time. So to get
a fresh copy of their docs or for those docs to be included you must compile them. Once you have the
other modules docs in place that the full manual depends on you can build the manual using the
following command:

----
mvn clean generate-resources -Djava.io.tmpdir=./
----
