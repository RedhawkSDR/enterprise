= RELEASE Engineering Notes

== How to Release

. update the release number property in the parent pom if this is another RC.

. mvn -P CFDependencies,docs,default,jaxb-generation release:prepare -Darguments=-Djava.io.tmpdir=./

. mvn release:perform -Darguments=-Djava.io.tmpdir=./

== Merging Forward

gitattributes should be able to accomplish this but it will fastforward if you've previously done merges on a particular file. 

=== Manual Way

Keep track of files you don't want to automagically merge forward and manually reset them: 

----
git merge --no-commit <merge-branch>
git reset HEAD myfile.txt
git checkout -- myfile.txt
git commit -m "merged <merge-branch>"
----
