[NOTE]
====
`nameserver` is the host/IP and the port of the omniNames server. This configuration is found in your
`omniORB.cfg` file. You'll have a line that looks like this:

----
InitRef = NameService=corbaname::127.0.0.1:2809
----

Use that host and port combination for the `nameserver` parameter in your URL. Below is the structure of a base
URL for the REDHAWK REST endpoints:

----
http://{host}:8181/cxf/redhawk/{nameserver host}:{nameserver port}
----

If you are using the REDHAWK Connector, you can replace `nameserver` & `port` with the connection name you specified when you created the connection. See <<REDHAWK Connector>> chapter for more details.

----
http://{host}:8181/cxf/redhawk/{redhawk-connect-name}
