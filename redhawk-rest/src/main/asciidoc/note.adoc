[NOTE]
====
`nameserver` is the host/IP and the port of the omniNames server:

----
http://{host}:8181/cxf/redhawk{nameserver host}:{nameserver port}
----

If you are using the REDHAWK Connector, you can replace `nameserver` with the connection name you specified when you created the connection. Make sure you specify `domainName` in your configuration.
