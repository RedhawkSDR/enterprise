== Getting Started

After installing REDHAWK Enterprise Integration, the following directories are displayed:

* `karaf-${karaf.version}`: Directory contains a custom distribution of Karaf prepackaged with all REDHAWK Java Tool assets. 
* `shell`: Programatic access to REDHAWK Driver via the shell. 
* `jacorb-deps`: All dependencies needed to configure REDHAWK Driver to use JacORB instead of the default ORB provided by Java.

=== Working with Karaf

. To start Karaf, in the bin directory for Karaf, run the start script:

Refer to the appropriate section in the online documentation for information about interacting with the individual assets. For more details on Karaf, refer to  https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/[Apache Karaf documentation].
