= REDHAWK Driver 

== Testing

To run integration tests follow instructions in above readme for testing. 

To run integration tests with Jacorb run the following command:

----
mvn clean install -P localIT -Djacorb=true
----

== Docs 

To generate the docs for redhawk-driver: 

----
mvn -Djava.io.tmpdir=./ -P docs generate-resources
----

=== Trouble Shooting

If you run into this error building the docs

----
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.asciidoctor:asciidoctor-maven-plugin:1.5.3:process-asciidoc (output-pdf) on project redhawk-rest: Execution output-pdf of goal org.asciidoctor:asciidoctor-maven-plugin:1.5.3:process-asciidoc failed: org.jruby.exceptions.RaiseException: (NotImplementedError) fstat unimplemented unsupported or native support failed to load -> [Help 1]
----

You'll need to specify the java.io.tmpdir with your maven command. So your command will end up looking like this:

----
mvn -P -Djava.io.tmpdir=./ -P jaxb-generation,docs generate-resources
----
