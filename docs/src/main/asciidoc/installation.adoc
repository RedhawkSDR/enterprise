== Installing REDHAWK Java Tools

=== Installing via Tarball

. Navigate to the directory where you want to install REDHAWK Java Tools, and untar the tarball:
+
----
tar xzf java-tools.tar.gz
----
+

. If not already set in your `.bashrc/.bash_profile`, set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable by adding the following
+
----
JAVA_HOME=[path to java 8]
export JAVA_HOME
----
+

. Source your .bashrc/.bash_profile:
+
----
. ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
----


=== Installing via RPM

. Run this command to install the RPM:
+
----
 rpm -i java-tools-<version>-noach.rpm
----
+
--
By default, the RPM  is installed in `/usr/local/redhawk`.
If you decided to resolve the dependency during install, the RPM installs jre-1.8 for you. Add a `JAVA_HOME` environment variable for Karaf to run properly.
