== Merging Forward

gitattributes should be able to accomplish this but it will fastforward if you've previously done merges on a particular file. 

=== Cherry Picking

Use cherry-pick to merge specific commits forward. 

----
git cherry-pick --no-commit <hash>
----

The `no-commit` allows you to see the changes that would happen before it commits.

=== Manual Way

Keep track of files you don't want to automagically merge forward and manually reset them: 

----
git merge --no-commit <merge-branch>
git reset HEAD myfile.txt
git checkout -- myfile.txt
git commit -m "merged <merge-branch>"
----

== Poms

The poms should mainly stay the same between develop and develop-2.X. Unless you've made updates to the pom that need to get merged. 

* Finding all poms

----
find . -name pom.xml
----

== Logging Updates between 2.0.X and 2.1.X

2.1.X has more logging capabilities so you need to be careful when merging those files forward.
