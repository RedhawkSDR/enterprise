== REDHAWK Demo Webapp

The REDHAWK Demo Webapp is an example web application that enables users to interact with a REDHAWK Domain via the web. The web application uses REDHAWK REST, REDHAWK WebSocket, and REDHAWK Driver. The jetty running in the Karaf Container serves as the web server. 

=== Instructions

To use this application, copy `redhawk-demo-webapp.jar` into the `$karaf.base/deploy` directory, which deploys the web application into Karaf. After the application is deployed, you can view the path of the webapp by entering the following command:

	web:list
	

Example output:


	karaf@root()> web:list
